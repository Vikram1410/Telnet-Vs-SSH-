# Telnet vs SSH

## 📌 Project Overview
This project presents a detailed comparative study of **Telnet** and **SSH (Secure Shell)**, two remote communication protocols used for accessing and managing network devices and servers. The objective is to understand their working principles, security aspects, advantages, limitations, and real-world use cases.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Understand the basic concepts of Telnet and SSH  
- Compare security mechanisms used by both protocols  
- Analyze advantages and disadvantages  
- Study real-time applications and use cases  
- Highlight why SSH replaced Telnet in modern networks

## 🧠 Technologies & Concepts Used
- Computer Networks
- Client–Server Architecture
- Remote Login Protocols
- Encryption & Authentication
- TCP/IP Networking

## 📖 Description

### 🔹 Telnet
Telnet is a **remote login protocol** that allows users to communicate with another computer over a network.  
- Data is transmitted in **plain text**
- No encryption or security
- Vulnerable to eavesdropping and attacks

### 🔹 SSH (Secure Shell)
SSH is a **secure remote access protocol** that provides encrypted communication between client and server.  
- Uses strong **encryption algorithms**
- Supports authentication using passwords and keys
- Ensures confidentiality and data integrity

## 🔍 Comparison Summary

| Feature        | Telnet            | SSH               |
|----------------|------------------|------------------|
| Security       | No encryption     | Encrypted        |
| Data Transfer  | Plain text        | Cipher text      |
| Port Number    | 23                | 22               |
| Authentication | Weak              | Strong           |
| Usage Today    | Obsolete          | Widely used      |

## ✅ Advantages of SSH
- Secure communication
- Prevents data interception
- Supports file transfer (SCP, SFTP)
- Strong authentication mechanisms

## ❌ Disadvantages of Telnet
- No security
- High risk of data theft
- Not suitable for modern networks

---

## 🏁 Conclusion
While Telnet played an important role in early networking, it lacks security and is no longer suitable for modern systems. **SSH is the preferred protocol today** due to its strong encryption, authentication, and secure data transmission.
